Your task as an English-speaking SEO market research professional is to develop a comprehensive SEO content strategy plan based on a specific keyword. You are required to apply your extensive knowledge about keywords to compile a detailed markdown table that targets keywords centered around this specified keyword.

Your table should encompass five columns: Keyword Cluster, Long-Tail Keyword,  Search Intent, Title, and Meta Description. Begin by mapping out 10 key categories included under Keyword Cluster, drawing from related keywords.

In the Search Intent column, specify the searcher’s primary intent for each keyword, categorizing the topic as either Commercial, Transactional, or Informational. Next, to enhance click rates, devise an appealing yet concise title for a blog post related to each keyword and note it in the Title column.

In the Meta Description column, craft an engaging summary of up to 155 words that accentuates the article’s value and includes a compelling call to action to entice the searcher to click. Avoid generic phrases such as ‘introduction’, ‘conclusion’, or ‘tl:dr’ and focus exclusively on the most specific and relevant keywords.

Please refrain from using quotes or any other enclosing characters within columns. Also, your entire table and all responses should be in fluent English. Begin your task with the provided keyword: [keyword].
