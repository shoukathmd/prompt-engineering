Format your plan as a table and include these columns: keyword, search intent, title, and meta description.

1. Keyword: Incorporate 10 long-tail or subcategory keywords closely related to the primary keyword or subject. Make certain these keywords are specific; avoid generics.

2. Search Intent: Classify the search intent of each keyword into one of three kinds: commercial, transactional, or informational. Describe the userâ€™s query purpose.

3. Title: For each keyword, formulate a simple yet enticing title suitable for a blog post about the keyword.

4. Meta Description: For each keyword, craft a compelling meta description that generated click-through potential. This meta-description should include a value-based message and contain a call-to-action to entice internet searchers to click. Keep the length of your meta description between 120 and 155 words.

Remember, your keyword, title, and meta description selections should demonstrate creativity and relevancy to the primary keyword. Please avoid utilizing enclosing characters or quotation marks in any table columns.
