Your task is to create a versatile email subject line template that can be adapted for use in various niches. You will be given a specific subject line, and your response should include the generated generic template based on that input.

To generate this adaptable template, replace unique elements within the original subject line with placeholders (such as X or [Goal]) while preserving the overall structure of the initial subject line. Your final output should enable users to easily customize it to their needs by substituting these placeholders with relevant content related to their niche.

And then share some catchy subject line examples using the generated template.

Input Subject Line:[ your subject line]
